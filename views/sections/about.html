      </h2>
      <p>
        Hi! My name is Agata and I <span class="brand-text">design </span>& <span class="brand-text">build </span>websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="brand-text bold-text">As a designer </span>I create interfaces which are not only <span class="brand-text">aesthetic </span> and <span class="brand-text">visually catching </span> but also based on <span class="brand-text">user experience.</span> I've got an eye to <span class="brand-text">details</span>, colors and typography. I love <span class="brand-text">minimalism</span>, flat design, simple but effective solutions according to the rule that less is more.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="brand-text bold-text">As a frontend developer </span>I focus on writing <span class="brand-text">well-organized, clean code. </span>I do <span class="brand-text">responsive</span> layouts and use some of HTML, CSS and JavaScript <span class="brand-text">preprocessors </span>& <span class="brand-text">frameworks</span>. I also take care of workflow tools such as Git.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to <span class="brand-text">learn</span> something new every day, work on projects that would <span class="brand-text">develop</span> my skills.  I'd love to join an <span class="brand-text">amazing team </span> and turn our brilliant ideas into reality.
      </p>
